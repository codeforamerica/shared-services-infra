# Documentation

As engineers, documentation often comes as an afterthought, but it is a critical
part of our work. Good, up-to-date documentation helps onboard new team members,
provides context for decisions and unfamiliar components, provides a reference
for folks outside the team or engineering, and can even open our code up to
outside contributions.

One method of promoting documentation to a first-class citizen is to integrate
it into our codebase. This allows us to keep documentation close where we're
working, so we're more likely to keep it up to date. It also allows us to
version our documentation alongside our code and the same tools we use to build
our code to build our documentation.

This service provides hosting for statically generated documentation. How you
build your documentation is up to you, but we recommend using [Material for
MkDocs][material], a framework built on [MkDocs]. This is a popular open source
tool that converts Markdown files in your repository into a static site for
documentation.
